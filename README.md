# Credit Application Program

This program was created by Will Mock, Thimothy Moorty, Valary Musibega and Christian Tuarez in order to fullfill the CS 3321 (Software Engineering) group project requirement as part of the Computer Science program at the University of Houston-Downtown.

This program implements a Python IDLE console GUI interface for three different types of users: administrators, business analysts and clients. The program allows clients to apply to a new line of credit, business analysts and administrators to approve/reject applications, while giving administrators the additional functions of adding/removing program users and modifying credit threshold values.

For data processing, this Python program uses .csv files as databases and pandas DataFrame objects for data manipulation and sorting.
